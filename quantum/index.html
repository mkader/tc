                            <h3>1. About the Web Services Terms of Service and Comcast Web Services</h3>
                            <p>Within these Web Services Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") the term "<strong>Comcast</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>" will refer to Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, Comcast Interactive
                                Media, LLC, and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates that own and operate
                                Websites and Internet services on their behalf. The term “you” refers to you as a user
                                of Comcast's Websites or Internet services described below.</p>
                            <h4>What do these Terms cover?</h4>
                            <p>These Terms set forth the terms and conditions through which Comcast will permit you to use these Comcast-owned and operated websites and services:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1.	the Websites <a href="http://www.comcast.net" target="_blank">www.comcast.net</a>, <a href="http://customer.comcast.com" target="_blank">customer.comcast.com</a>, <a href="www.tunerfish.com" target="_blank">www.tunerfish.com</a> and <a href="http://www.plaxo.com" target="_blank">www.plaxo.com</a> (the "<strong>Comcast Sites</strong>"); and</li>
                                <li>2.	all software and services provided by Plaxo, including those services made available by Plaxo through its application programming interfaces ("APIs") (collectively the "Plaxo Service"); and</li>
                                <li>3.	all software and services provided by Tunerfish, including those services made available by Tunerfish through its application programming interfaces ("APIs") (collectively the "Tunerfish Service", and collectively, (1), (2), and (3) the "Comcast Web Services").</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>What is outside the scope of these Terms?</h4>
                            <p>These Terms <strong>do not apply</strong> to your use of any other products or services provided by
                                Comcast such as Comcast Digital Cable with On Demand, Comcast Digital Voice, Comcast
                                High Speed Internet, XFINITY TV, XFINITY Internet, and XFINITY Voice. If you subscribe
                                to or use one or more of these services, you can see the terms that apply to the
                                residential versions of these services by
                                visiting <a href=" http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html" target="_blank"> http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html</a>.</p>

                            <p>These Terms also <strong>do not apply</strong> to your use of the XFINITY TV Store
                                (<a href="http://store.xfinitytv.comcast.net" target="_blank">store.xfinitytv.comcast.net</a>). Comcast's use of the information you provide through the
                                XFINITY TV Store is described in the XFINITY TV Store Privacy Policy, available at
                                <a href="http://store.xfinitytv.comcast.net/TermsOfUse.aspx" target="_blank">http://store.xfinitytv.comcast.net/TermsOfUse.aspx</a>.</p>

                            <p>Some of the Comcast Web Services contain links to other Websites, including Websites of
                                third parties who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers, or providers. These
                                other Websites are not operated by Comcast and have their own terms of service that we
                                encourage you to read before you use them. Other sites that we link to may contain
                                Comcast branding, but these non-Comcast Websites and resources are provided by companies
                                or persons other than Comcast. Examples of these non-Comcast Websites include Websites
                                where you are required to log-in using a username and password other than your username
                                and password for the Comcast Web Services, such as the Jobs channel and the Dating
                                channel on <a href="http://Comcast.net" target="_blank">Comcast.net</a>. These Terms <strong>do not apply</strong> to those non-Comcast sites. Those sites
                                will have their own terms of use that we encourage you to read before you use them.</p>

                            <h3>2. Accepting These Terms</h3>

                            <p>In order for you to use any of the Comcast Web Services, you must first agree to abide by the Terms. You can accept these Terms by:</p>

                                <li>b.	Using any of the Comcast Web Services, in which case you understand and agree that these Terms will apply to your use of those services (or any parts of them).</li>

                            <p>You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password(s) you use to access the Comcast Web Services. Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Comcast for all activities that occur under your Comcast Web Services accounts, and will be responsible for any breach of these Terms caused by these activities.

                            <h3>6. Privacy and Your Personal Information</h3>
                            <p>To understand how the Comcast Web Services use information you provide, please read the Web Services Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.comcast.net/privacy/2011-03/" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.net/privacy/2011-03/</a>. This policy explains how Comcast and its providers handle your personal information when you register and use the Comcast Web Services.</p>

                            <h3>7. Content on the Comcast Web Services</h3>
                            <p>The Comcast Web Services will allow you to access information, such as collections of data, video, audio, or other multimedia, and photographs and other static images (the "<strong>Content</strong>"). This Content may be owned by Comcast, other companies that give Comcast the right to distribute their Content (like movie publishers), or users of the Comcast Web Services (like you). Comcast grants you a limited license to view the Content and to use the Comcast Web Services for personal, non-commercial purposes as set forth in these Terms or in a manner that does not require a license. Unless the Content was legally posted by you on the Comcast Web Services, you may not distribute copies of the Content in any form (including by e-mail or other electronic means), without prior written permission from its owner except as permitted by law. Of course, you are free to encourage others to access the Content and to tell them how to find it.</p>
                            <p>In addition, our Content providers want to remind you that you must not remove, alter, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices marked on the Content or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure associated with the Content. The copying, downloading, stream capturing, reproduction, duplication, archiving, distribution, uploading, publication, modification, translation, broadcast, performance, display, sale, or transmission of the Content is strictly prohibited unless it is expressly permitted by Comcast in writing. You may not incorporate the Content into any hardware or software application. This prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative materials free of charge.</p>
                            <p>You understand that by using the Comcast Web Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable. In this respect, you use the Comcast Web Services at your own risk. If you would like to use them, there are commercially available services and software that can limit exposure to material that you may find objectionable. The Comcast High Speed Internet service provides security information and tools for all users, including parents, at <a href="http://security.comcast.net/" target="_blank">http://security.comcast.net/</a>. Some of the tools may require that you be a registered Comcast High Speed Internet user in order to download and use them.</p>

                            <h3>8. User Submissions</h3>
                            <p>Some of the material appearing on the Comcast Web Services will be provided by users. Comcast does not claim ownership of any material that users submit or post on the Comcast Web Services. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Comcast has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any material that you create, transmit, or display while using the Comcast Web Services, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Comcast may suffer) by doing so. Further, you agree that, with respect to any communication you submit to us for posting on the Comcast Web Services, you will not: (i) include any content that violates a third party's copyright or other proprietary or privacy rights; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations portrayed as fact; (iii) include any advertising or solicitations; or (iv) submit any material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise clearly inappropriate.</p>
                            <p>If you post any content to the Comcast Web Services, you hereby grant Comcast and its licensees a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute the content, on or in connection with the Comcast Web Services or the promotion of the Comcast Web Services, and incorporate it in other works, in whole or in part, in any manner. You represent and warrant that you own the content or otherwise have sufficient rights in it to grant to Comcast the license set forth in this section without infringing or violating the rights of any third party. If you remove content that you have posted to the Comcast Web Services or terminate your Comcast Web Services account, this license will automatically expire, with a few limited exceptions. Comcast may retain, but will not actively use, copies of your data that were archived in the normal course of Comcast's database backups. In addition, copies of content that you have shared with other users of the Comcast Web Services may be retained by Comcast and associated with those other users' accounts in order to provide them with the Comcast Web Services. Comcast does not assert any ownership over content that you post to the Comcast Web Services; rather, as between us and you, subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms, you retain full ownership of all content you post to the Comcast Web Services and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with the content.</p>
                            <p>The Comcast Web Services may also contain links to community forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs about the various Comcast Web Services. Children under the age of 13 should not post in any of the forums, boards, chat rooms, blogs, other editorial sections of the Comcast Web Services. Participants in these forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs are solely responsible for all content that they post there. Comcast retains the right, but not the obligation, to correct any errors or omissions in any of this content, as it may determine in its sole discretion. Comcast further reserve the right to delete or remove any content from the forums or blogs without prior notice or liability. You agree that your participation in these forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs will at all times conform with the policy available here: <a href="http://www.comcast.net/blog/comment-policy" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.net/blog/comment-policy</a>.</p>
                            <p>Comcast reserves the right, but does not assume any obligation, to review any user submission prior to its display on the Comcast Web Services using automated tools or manual processes. Comcast may refuse to display or remove any user submission from the Comcast Web Services for any reason in our sole discretion. However, we will typically only do so when we become aware that the material in question is harmful, clearly illegal, or likely to be considered highly offensive or objectionable to a large segment of our users.</p>

                            <h3>9. Feedback</h3>
                            <p>Comcast welcomes your feedback about the Comcast Web Services. Comcast asks that you limit your feedback to the Comcast Web Services. Any communications you send to Comcast are deemed to be submitted on a non-confidential basis and become the sole property of Comcast. Comcast may, in its sole discretion, reproduce, use, publish, modify, disclose, distribute, or otherwise use these communications in any way and for any purpose. All of these uses by Comcast shall be without liability or obligation of any kind to you. These uses may include, for example, use of the content of any of these communications, including any works, marks or names, ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose without any obligation to compensate the originator of the communications and without liability to that person.</p>

                            <h3>10. Proprietary Rights</h3>
                            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Comcast (or Comcast's licensors) own all legal right, title, and interest in and to the Comcast Web Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Comcast Web Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
                            <p>Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Comcast, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Comcast's trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features except as permitted by law. If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Comcast, then you agree that your use of these features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Comcast's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time.</p>
                            <p>Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Comcast, you agree that in using the Comcast Web Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of these marks, names or logos.</p>

                            <h3>11. Linking to the Comcast Sites</h3>
                            <p>Comcast welcomes links to the homepages of any of the Comcast Sites. You are free to establish a hypertext link to these homepages so long as the link does not state or imply any affiliation, connection, sponsorship, or approval of your site by Comcast. Comcast does not permit framing or inline linking to the Comcast Sites or any portions of them.</p>

                            <h3>12. License from Comcast</h3>
                            <p>Comcast gives you a worldwide, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Comcast Web Services for your personal, non-commercial use on the terms and conditions described in these Terms. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Comcast Web Services as provided by Comcast, in the manner permitted by the Terms.</p>

                            <h3>13. Discontinuing Use of the Comcast Web Services and Termination of the Terms; Provisions That Remain in Effect after Termination</h3>
                            <p>The Terms apply to all users of the Comcast Web Services. Except as described below, depending on whether you are an unregistered user or a registered user, you can discontinue your use of the Comcast Web Services so that these Terms no longer apply to you.</p>

                            <h4>Unregistered Users</h4>
                            <p>If you use any of the Comcast Web Services (or parts of those services) that are accessible without registration, you may discontinue use of those services at any time. Doing so will terminate the Terms. If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of the Comcast Web Services and terminate the Terms. We may take these actions with or without notice to you. Because unregistered users are generally unknown to us, in most cases we will be unable to give notice of these actions.</p>

                            <p>If you use any of the Comcast Web Services (or parts of those services) as a registered user, you may terminate your registered user account at any time. Doing so will delete your account and, because you can no longer use the service associated with that account, terminate the Terms with respect to that service. If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your registered user account for any or all of the Comcast Web Services and terminate the Terms. We may take these actions with or without notice to you. Because registered users are known to us, however, we will generally use reasonable efforts to give notice of these actions.</p>

                            <p>Sections 8, 10, 13 through 16, and 22 of these Terms will survive termination, and shall continue to apply indefinitely.</p>

                            <h3>17. Copyright Infringement</h3>
                            <p>Comcast is committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and requires all users of the Comcast Web Services to comply with these laws. Accordingly, you may not use the Comcast Web Services to store any material or content, or disseminate any material or content, in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law.</p>
                            <p>If you are the owner of any copyrighted work and believe your rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed by any material on the Comcast Web Services, you may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "<strong>DMCA</strong>") by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, Comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly infringing work(s) accessible through the Comcast Web Services or (ii) to disable access to the work(s). It is Comcast's policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate access to the Comcast Web Services (or any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights. Comcast may terminate access to the Comcast Web Services at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user. If the affected user believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter notification to Comcast. Upon Comcast's receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures with respect to a received counter notification. In all events, you expressly agree that Comcast will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.</p>
                            <p>Copyright owners may send Comcast a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged infringements of their works to:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>Any notification of claimed infringement must be in a form that satisfies the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act.
